[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcamera_lite_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "camera_lite_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "camera_lite_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    camera_lite_interfacesConfig.cmake
    camera_lite_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "camera_lite_interfaces" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "camera_lite_interfaces_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "camera_lite_interfaces" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
